                <p id="intro">
                    Hi! I'm Andy. Welcome to my portfolio, this is where I will showcase some of the projects that I have been working on. But first, a little bit about me. 
                    I am currently 30 years old. I live in a city called Southampton, which is located in the south of England. I live with my girlfriend and our Golden Retriever, Piper.
                    We like to go on holiday as much as possible and that does include Piper!

                <h3>Openreach</h3>
                <p id="employment">
                    For the last eight years I was working for a telecoms company called Openreach. It was an enjoyable place to work and only have good things to say about it, but after eight good years it felt like it was time for a change.
                    The company had been offering voluntary redundancies for team members and I felt that it was my time to move on. I have learned a lot from the company and definitely have skills that will stay with me for a long time.
                    Over the years I have done a few different roles, from starting as an apprentice to leaving as a 'Field Based Coordinator.' As well as many valuable skills, I will be leaving having made many friends that I hope to continue to see outside of work.

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p id="hobbies">
                    I have a few different hobbies, my two main hobbies are football and learning the Spanish language. I am a fan of Southampton FC and try to get to St. Mary's as much as possible.
                    I play football twice a week, 7-a-side and 5-a-side, Mondays and Tuesdays. It's usually a given that on Wednesdays my legs are a little worse for wear!
                    As I mentioned previously, I am learning Spanish and have been so for the last two and a bit years. This is something I started because I just 'liked' the Spanish language, but now as the months go by it is something I thoroughly enjoy.
                    Being able to speak another language isn't just about learning to speak it, but you also find yourself learning all about the culture through the people you are learning from.
                    I was lucky enough to visit South America for two months in 2023 and the experience was unforgettable!
                    There is a very rich and vibrant culture, the people I met were all so warm and welcoming and of course, you can't mention South America without mentioning the breathtaking scenery!
